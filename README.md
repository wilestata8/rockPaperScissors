# rockPaperScissors

We all loved to play rock, paper, scissors as a child.  I have re-created this childhood game using a bot. Play against the bot and try to win by selecting the strongest weapon.

## Lessons Learned


I built the project to practice on my journey of mastering functions. When building this project, I encountered issues with getting the function to work properly. I used console log and online resources to fix my functions. I ended up with this fun game list here.
